Anjana suffers from a debilitating case of curiosity, which led her from philosophy to English teaching to computational linguistics to software development.

A Mozilla TechSpeaker and alumna of the Recurse Center and Outreachy, she can often be found coding in San Francisco; that is, when she's not speaking at events around the world to share the joy of programming and promote a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.

Talk to her about programming paradigms, language design, and linguistics.
