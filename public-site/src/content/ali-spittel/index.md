Ali is a software engineer at DEV. Before that, she was a lead instructor at General Assembly. She loves Python, JavaScript, and talking about code. She is most interested in the intersection of code, art, and social justice.

When Ali's not working, you can find her watching New England sports, competing on CodeWars, taking runs around Capitol Hill, rock climbing, or participating in DC coding community events.

Ali also blogs at dev.to/aspittel where she talks about code and her life surrounding it.
